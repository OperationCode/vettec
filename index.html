        <h1>VET-TEC Act</h1>
        <p>
          The Veteran Employment Through Technology Education Courses Act (or the VET-TEC Act) is a new bill being introduced to help veterans attend code schools -
          vocational programs that train students to become software developers. You can view this bill <a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1989">here</a>.

          This bill, at an annual $15m for five years, is aimed at getting veterans into non-traditional education programs like code schools. Payments to code schools are as follows:
          <ul>
            <li> 25 percent of the cost of providing the program of education upon the enrollment of an eligible veteran in the program.
            <li> 25 percent of such cost upon the completion of the program by the veteran.
            <li> 50 percent of such cost upon the employment of the veteran following completion of the program.
            <li> A monthly housing stipend.
          </ul>

          <p>April 6, 2017</p>

          <p>Dear Community,</p>

          <p>We are at a pivotal time in our country - where those who've served in uniform are trying to reintegrate into civilian society, to well-paid jobs in the tech industry. Unfortunately, they are unable to use their New GI Bill benefits earned through their service to learn to code and become software developers, due to undue bureaucratic processes that plague our states and federal government.</p>

          <p>As we already know, when we committed the first line of code and launched on August 21, 2014 - there were no code schools across our country that were approved by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to accept New GI Bill benefits, and allow our veterans to learn to code and get a job in tech. While there are now over half a dozen that accept the GI Bill, from Code Fellows in Seattle to the Nashville School of Software in Tennessee - it's nowhere near enough to fill tech job vacancies all across our nation.</p>

          <p>According to Code.org, a non-profit dedicated to expanding access to computer science, there are more than 500,000 open computing jobs nationwide, but less than 43,000 computer science graduates that go into the workforce. What's worse, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts there will be 1.4 million more software development jobs than applicants who can fill them by 2020.</p>

          <p>Annually, over 250,000 service members exit the military. Our transitioning service members, citizen soldiers, veterans and military spouses deserve much more than red tape to learn technical skills to fill our nation's technical talent shortage.</p>

          <p>Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy has introduced legislation to put a dent in this problem and help veterans get the training that they've earned.</p>

          <p>The VET-TEC Act is simple. It will expand the existing Accelerated Learning Program (ALP) pilot to include code schools, vocational programs that teach students in a relatively short amount of time to be software developers and get a job at a tech company writing code. This legislation has no impact on the New GI Bill, or burdened by cumbersome bureaucracy.</p>

          <p>We believe our members shouldn't have to fight fires in the Montana mountains, pour concrete just outside the gates of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, or stock shelves at their local grocery store to save money to go to code school and train to become software developers.</p>

          <p>We believe in sensible legislation that eliminates red tape, removes over bureaucratic systems and streamlines reintegration training for those who've worn the uniform and their families to join or start an American technology company.</p>

          <p>We believe there is no better way to become a software developer than through a coding bootcamp.</p>

          <p>We believe every company is a tech company and increasing the technical talent pipeline should be filled by our nation's finest.</p>

          <p>The vast majority of our members are part of the newest Greatest Generation who've served both here and abroad and deserve a shot to prove their latest skills as they have proved while serving in uniform.</p>

          <p>Join us in supporting the VET-TEC Act.</p>

          <p>Join us as we Code the Future and ensure no veteran is left behind in the 21st Century New Skills Economy.</p>

          <p>Together we are Operation Code.</p>
