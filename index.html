        <h2> What It Is:</h2>
        <!-- <p>The Vet Tec bill, is a bill that will be enacted to direct the Secretary
          of veterans affairs to carry out a technology education pilot program,
          making code schools more accesssible for veterans by providing eligible
          veterans with the opportunity to enroll in high technology programs of
          education.</p> -->

        <div class="what_it_does">
          <h2>What It Does:</h2>
          <!-- <p>The Vet Tec bill provides funding for high technology training, such as
            bootcamps, as well as a housing stipend for veterans who wish to pursue a
            career in technology. </p> -->

          <div class="eligibility">
            <h2>Eligibility:</h2>
            <!-- <p>The Vet Tec bill would cover any veteran who is entitled to education
              assistance administered by the VA.</p> -->

              <h2>What It Means:</h2>
              <!-- <p>The Vet Tec bill, will allow the ability for veterans who wish to pursue
                a career in technology to get the education that they need, with not only
                the support of the department of Veterans Affairs, but the education
                institutions in which they would be attending.</p> -->

                <h2>Who Benefits:</h2>
                <!-- <p>Our Veterans: Passing this bill will ensure that our veterans
                  will have access to high quality education and to better jobs,
                  guaranteeing a better quality of life.
                  <p>Their Families: Passing this bill will ensure that our veterans will be able to
                  re-enter the workforce in a timely fashion, thus making transition from military
                  life to civilian life a lot less hectic. It will lessen the strain that some
                  military families feel while making adjustmets to civilian life.</p>
                  <p>The Tech Community: The passing of this bill will not only enable veterans to
                  improve their lives, but also veterans will be able to put that discipline,
                  and hard work to use  outside of the military. By aiding our vets in entering
                  the modern work force we are tapping into a veritable pool of untapped talent
                  that would otherwise go to waste because programs like this just does not exist.</p>
